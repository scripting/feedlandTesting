# feedlandTesting

A private repo for testing new FeedLand features.

### Welcome

Thanks for accepting my invitation to be part of the initial testers for a new important FeedLand feature. 

I want a chance to test it out with a few users before making any kind of announcement, so it's especially important that you keep everything we talk about here in confidence, until it's announced publicly. 

I'll post a message in the Issues section to explain what's going on when we're ready to take the first step.
