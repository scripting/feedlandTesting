# feedlandTesting

A private repo for testing new FeedLand features.

### Welcome

Thanks for accepting my invitation to be part of the initial testers for a new important FeedLand feature. 

I want a chance to test it out with a few users before making any kind of announcement, so it's especially important that you keep everything we talk about here in confidence, until it's announced publicly. 

I have posted a <a href="https://github.com/scripting/feedlandTesting/issues/1">message</a> in the Issues section to explain what's going on.
